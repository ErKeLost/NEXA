### Tailscale Grant Examples

Source: https://tailscale.com/kb/1017/install

Examples illustrating the use of grants in Tailscale policy files, which define permissions for users and groups to manage specific resources like tags or nodes.

```APIDOC
Tailscale Grant Examples:

  Purpose:
    Grants define permissions for users or groups to manage specific resources within the tailnet, such as tags or nodes.

  Grant Syntax:
    Grants are typically defined within the `tagOwners` or similar sections of the policy file.

  Example: Granting Tag Management Permissions:
    // Allow the 'operations' group to manage nodes tagged with 'tag:prod-servers'
    "tagOwners": {
      "tag:prod-servers": ["group:operations"]
    }

  Example: Granting Node Management Permissions:
    // Allow a specific user to manage nodes tagged with 'tag:dev-workstations'
    "nodeOwners": {
      "tag:dev-workstations": ["user:alice@example.com"]
    }

  Example: Granting Exit Node Usage:
    // Allow users in the 'vpn-users' group to use nodes tagged as exit nodes
    "exitNodeOwners": {
      "*": ["group:vpn-users"]
    }

  Note:
    The exact structure and keywords for grants might evolve. Refer to the official Tailscale documentation for the most up-to-date syntax.

  Purpose:
    App Connectors enable secure outbound connections from your tailnet to external services.

  Setup:
    1. Ensure the node intended to be an App Connector has Tailscale installed and running.
    2. Configure the node to advertise specific routes or services that it will connect to externally.
    3. Use the Tailscale API or CLI to manage App Connector configurations and permissions.

  Use Cases:
    - Connecting to external databases.
    - Accessing cloud services from within your tailnet.
    - Securely integrating with third-party APIs.

  Configuration Details:

    Regularly review and update ACLs as your network evolves.

2.  **Tags**: Utilize tags effectively to categorize and manage access for groups of devices.

3.  **Subnet Routers**: Deploy subnet routers for controlled access to on-premises networks.
    Ensure subnet routers are highly available.

4.  **Key Rotation**: Implement a strategy for rotating Tailscale keys to enhance security.

5.  **Monitoring**: Monitor Tailscale status, logs, and client metrics for any anomalies.
    Consider integrating with your existing monitoring solutions.

6.  **Device Management**: Regularly audit devices connected to your tailnet and remove unused or unauthorized devices.

7.  **SSH Access**: If using Tailscale SSH, configure session recording and enforce strong access policies.

--------------------------------

### Tailscale High Availability Setup

Source: https://tailscale.com/kb/1017/install

Information on setting up Tailscale for high availability, ensuring continuous connectivity and service availability even if individual nodes or network paths fail.

```APIDOC
Tailscale High Availability:

  Concepts:
    High availability in Tailscale is achieved through redundancy and failover mechanisms inherent in its design.

  Key Features:
    - **Redundant Nodes**: Running multiple instances of services or nodes that can take over if one fails.
    - **Exit Nodes & Subnet Routers**: Having multiple exit nodes or subnet routers allows for failover if one becomes unavailable.
    - **DNS Configuration**: Utilizing DNS for service discovery ensures that clients can always find available instances of a service.

  Implementation:
    1. **Deploy Redundant Services**: Run critical services on multiple Tailscale nodes.
    2. **Configure Load Balancing/Failover**: Use external or internal mechanisms to direct traffic to available service instances.
    3. **Advertise Routes/Services**: Ensure that redundant nodes correctly advertise their services or subnets.
    4. **Policy File**: Use ACLs to define failover behavior or preferred paths if necessary.

  Example Scenario:
    If you have two web servers (`web1`, `web2`) in your tailnet, you can configure DNS or a load balancer to direct traffic to whichever server is available.

Technical Overviews:

Architecture:
  Tailscale utilizes a distributed system architecture comprising a control plane
  for coordination and authentication, and a data plane for peer-to-peer communication
  using WireGuard.

Protocols:
  - WireGuard: Used for secure, encrypted, and high-performance VPN tunnels.
  - HTTPS: Used for communication between clients and the Tailscale control plane.

Key Features:
  - **Identity-based access**: Access control is based on user identity rather than IP addresses.
  - **NAT Traversal**: Leverages techniques like STUN/TURN to establish direct connections
    between nodes even behind restrictive NATs.
  - **Zero-configuration**: Simplifies network setup and management.
  - **Policy-based access control**: Fine-grained control over network traffic using ACLs.

### User-Defined MCP Descriptions for Agent Guidance

Source: https://context7_llms

Enables users to provide custom descriptions for MCPs to guide the AI agent's understanding and usage. This allows for defining specific semantics and safety constraints, such as preventing the sharing of personal information with certain tools.

```APIDOC
MCP Usage Semantics Definition:
  install(mcp_definition, user_semantics):
    Parameters:
      mcp_definition: Object containing MCP details (as above)
      user_semantics: Object or string defining how the agent should interpret and use the MCP.
        Example:
          "This MCP is for calculating taxes. Do not send personal information beyond product categories and prices to it."
    Behavior:
      The AI agent should incorporate `user_semantics` into its decision-making process when interacting with the tools provided by the MCP.
      This prevents the agent from using tools in ways not intended by the user, especially concerning data privacy and security.
    Purpose:
      Allows users to define specific operational guidelines for MCPs.
      Enhances safety by controlling data flow and tool usage based on user intent.
      Mitigates risks associated with MCPs exporting tools not explicitly known or controlled in system prompts.

### OpenAI Function Calling to Tools Evolution

Source: https://docs.freestyle.sh/llms-full.txt

Traces the evolution of tool integration in OpenAI models, from the early 'function-calling' in GPT-3.5-turbo to the more advanced 'tools' in GPT-4. This section highlights the limitations of early standards and the shift towards more complex tool definitions.

```APIDOC
OpenAI Function Calling and Tools:

GPT-3.5-turbo-0613 (June 2023):
  - Introduced `function-calling`.
  - Early, almost all first-party tools.
  - Examples: `send_email`, `get_current_weather`, `get_customers_by_revenue`, `extract_people_data`.
  - Limitations: Too limiting.

GPT-4:
  - Deprecated `functions` in favor of `tools`.
  - Allowed for more complex definitions.
  - Enabled domain-specific tasks with a series of tools.
  - Still largely first-party tools.

### Freestyle AI Upcoming Features

Source: https://docs.freestyle.sh/llms-full.txt

This section details the planned features and development progress for Freestyle AI. It includes items that are completed, in progress, or cancelled, providing a roadmap for future enhancements.

```markdown
- [x] **Usage/Metrics**: We are working on generalized metrics for all our API
- [ ] **Usage/Metrics V2**: We are working on more granular metrics for all our APIs, including specific domain, user and deployment tracking. We're also examining the concept of script injection for granular metrics on your user's behavior across the apps you deploy.

- [x] **Git Triggers**: We are working on Git triggers to allow you to run code actions are taken on a Git repository you manage
- [x] **Python SDK**: We are working on a Python SDK to allow you to interact with Freestyle from Python more easily (Released, feature incomplete)
- [ ] **Better DNS**: We are working on improvements to our DNS API to make it more powerful, support more record types, be easier to delete records and have a UI in our Dashboard

- [ ] ~~**Hot Module Replacement**: We are working on a Serverless HMR solution to give instant deploys for those who can't wait for builds~~ (Cancelled in favor of dev servers)
- [ ] ~~**Firecracker Service**: We are working on a Firecracker service to give you the ability to run Firecrackers on your users behalf~~ (Cancelled in favor of dev servers)
- [x] **Dev Servers**: New service to run development servers, display their previews to your users, and give your AI Access to control them.
- [ ] **Dev Servers Computer Use**: We've already shipped chromium into our dev servers, making them prepared to run your playwright in VM without any external services, but we're beta testing adding a pre-built computer use tool for our customers to be able to let their AI try their apps in dev.
- [ ] **Dev Server File System Decoupling**: Running dev servers is expensive, we're working to decouple the filesystem from the dev server so you can read/write from it without starting the machine — this will mean you don't have to start the server until your AI is done generating code, saving you a lot of compute hours and money.
- [ ] **Dev Server Stingy Mode**: This is a dev server mode we're working on to exponentially cut down on your dev server costs. We're not sharing too much about it yet, but its going to mean you only pay for the compute you use — think serverless dev servers.

- [ ] **Freestyle MCP**: We're working on Freestyle Cloud MCP to allow your AI to pull your debug logs and help you build with Freestyle more easily.

### Device Management and MagicDNS

Source: https://tailscale.com/kb/1017/install

This section details how to manage devices within your Tailscale network, including renaming them for better organization and utilizing MagicDNS for simplified host communication.

```markdown
Every device added to a tailnet, including servers, nodes, phones, and personal computers is assigned a unique name generated from the device's OS hostname. This name is displayed in the [**Machines**](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines) page of the admin console. You can also [rename a device](/kb/1098/machine-names#renaming-a-machine) to help you locate and organize devices in the **Machines** page list.

[MagicDNS](/kb/1081/magicdns) makes communicating with devices across your tailnet easier by allowing you to use the name listed in the **Machines** page of the admin console instead of an IP address. This works using automatically assigned OS hostnames or renamed device names. MagicDNS is enabled by default, and we recommend you keep it enabled.
```

### GitHub Synchronization Architecture

Source: https://docs.freestyle.sh/llms-full.txt

Details the technical architecture behind Freestyle's GitHub integration, including the role of GitHub Apps, webhook processing, bidirectional sync, and conflict detection mechanisms.

```markdown
## How It Works

Freestyle's GitHub integration uses GitHub Apps to provide secure, repository-specific access. When you push code to either platform, changes are automatically synchronized to the other, ensuring both repositories stay in sync.

### Architecture

1. **GitHub App**: You own the custom Github app with repository permissions for secure access to the repositories on Github
2. **Webhook Processing**: You get real-time notifications when code changes occur on Github or on Freestyle
3. **Bidirectional Sync**: When a change is made on the Github repository, its proactively synced to the Freestyle repository, and vice versa
4. **Conflict Detection**: We prevents data loss by detecting diverged branches before applying changes
```

--------------------------------

### GitHub Synchronization Architecture

Source: https://context7_llms

Details the technical architecture behind Freestyle's GitHub integration, including the role of GitHub Apps, webhook processing, bidirectional sync, and conflict detection mechanisms.

```markdown
## How It Works

Freestyle's GitHub integration uses GitHub Apps to provide secure, repository-specific access. When you push code to either platform, changes are automatically synchronized to the other, ensuring both repositories stay in sync.

### Architecture

1. **GitHub App**: You own the custom Github app with repository permissions for secure access to the repositories on Github
2. **Webhook Processing**: You get real-time notifications when code changes occur on Github or on Freestyle
3. **Bidirectional Sync**: When a change is made on the Github repository, its proactively synced to the Freestyle repository, and vice versa
4. **Conflict Detection**: We prevents data loss by detecting diverged branches before applying changes
```

--------------------------------

### Tag Object Structure

Source: https://docs.freestyle.sh/llms-full.txt

  name: string;
  // The tagger (may be null for lightweight tags)
  tagger?: {
    date: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
  };
  // The tag message (may be null for lightweight tags)
  message?: string;
  // The object this tag points to (usually a commit)
  target: {
    sha: string;
  };
  // The tag's hash
  sha: string;
}

### Revamping Docs for AI Accessibility

Source: https://docs.freestyle.sh/llms-full.txt

This section explains the strategy behind revamping Freestyle's documentation to be more accessible to AI models. It highlights issues with relative URLs and HTML/CSS/JS content, and the solution of using raw markdown.

```javascript
import { cursorUrl, vscodeUrl } from "../../../src/lib/cursor-link";
```

```markdown
## Background

Freestyle is [a cloud to run AI Code](/). We provide a series of tools to manage code written by AI Agents. The tools we're building are weird, as they are oriented at new problems relating to untrusted code that haven't been discussed much before. Without a lot of explanation they can be hard to understand.

We try to regularly have coffee, and hack days with our customers. Over the course of hack days a few weeks ago, we noticed the way we were being used had changed. Our users didn't want to read our docs, they wanted to ask AI questions about them — and AI was giving them the wrong answers. We went through a pivot 11 months ago, and half the time it was still responding about our old product. Sometimes it hallucinated APIs we didn't have, and we even once heard of it giving code snippets referencing how to use one of our competitors!

## How we revamped our Docs for AI

We decided to add a series of functionalities to our docs to make them more accessible to AI, and therefore our users. They are as follows:

### LLMs.txt

We started with an [llms.txt](/llms.txt) and [llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt) that we generated from our content. However, we did it badly.

Our first generation of the llms.txt files used **relative urls**. This meant that users who copy and pasted the file into their own agents couldn't get anything. Further, a lot of AI docs scrapers are bad, and just didn't handle relative urls at all.

Once we fixed that, we still originally linked directly to docs pages. This made AI clients reading the pages read the full html/css/js of the page and not just the text. The worst side effect of this is that we have lots of tab views in our docs that default to JavaScript, when AI Scrapers would read these pages they wouldn't get any Python documentation for our Python users. So we re-exported all of our docs files with a `.md` extension — any page on this website can be gone to with .md at the end of the URL and it will return the raw markdown content of the page, here's [this page](/blog/docs-revamp.md) as markdown.
```

### Git on VM as Source of Truth - Drawbacks

Source: https://docs.freestyle.sh/llms-full.txt

This section details the limitations of using Git on a VM as the source of truth. While it introduces version control, it still faces challenges with scalability, portability, backup, and performance bottlenecks due to VM access requirements for Git operations.

```markdown
- Scalability issues
- Portability issues
- Backup issues
- Performance bottlenecks
- Increased runtime cost
```

--------------------------------

### Install Hono package for static asset deployment

Source: https://docs.freestyle.sh/web/frameworks/static

Installs the Hono package to serve static assets. This is a necessary step to create a server that can serve static files on Freestyle.

```bash
npm init -y # Only necessary if you don't have a package.json in the root directory already  #
npm install hono
```

--------------------------------

### Create Domain Verification Request

Source: https://docs.freestyle.sh/llms-full.txt

Creates a domain verification request with Freestyle using Python. This process involves generating a verification code that needs to be added as a TXT DNS record for the domain.

```python
import freestyle

client = freestyle.Freestyle("YOUR_FREESTYLE_API_KEY")

verification_request = client.create_domain_verification_request(
    domain="yourdomain.com" # this also works for subdomains
)

print("Domain verification request created successfully!")
print(f"Domain: {verification_request.domain}")
print(f"Verification Code: {verification_request.verification_code}")
print(f"Id: {verification_request.id}")

```

### Git on VM as Source of Truth - Drawbacks

Source: https://context7_llms

This section discusses the limitations of using Git on a VM as the source of truth. While it introduces version control, it still faces challenges with scalability, portability, backup, and performance bottlenecks due to VM access requirements for Git operations.

```text
While you can track changes and collaborate better, you still face issues with scalability, portability, and backup. The VM must still be accessed for every Git operation, which can lead to performance bottlenecks and increased runtime cost.
```

--------------------------------

### Invoke Agent with Code Execution (TypeScript)

Source: https://context7_llms

Demonstrates how to invoke an agent with a user query that requires code execution. The result of the code execution is then logged to the console.

```ts
const result = await agent.invoke({
  messages: [
    { role: "user", content: "What is the factorial of 13 divided by 55^2" },
  ],
});
console.log(result.messages.at(-1)?.content);
```

--------------------------------

### Grant Repository Permissions for CI

Source: https://context7_llms

Assigns specific permissions (e.g., 'write') to a Git identity for a given repository, allowing CI systems to interact with the code.

```javascript
await sandboxes.grantPermission({
  identityId: ciIdentity.id,
  repoId: "repo-id",
  permission: "write",
});
```

--------------------------------

### Install Freestyle Sandboxes

Source: https://docs.freestyle.sh/code-execution/integrations/mastra

Installs the necessary Freestyle Sandboxes package using npm. This is the first step to integrating Freestyle's capabilities into your project.

```bash
npm install @mastra/core freestyle-sandboxes
```

```typescript
server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, 
  async (request, response) => {
    const result = await listTools(request.body);
    response.send(result);
  }
);

// Example of creating a database record with hints
const createDatabaseRecord = (hints: {
  readOnlyHint?: boolean;
  destructiveHint?: boolean;
  idempotentHint?: boolean;
  openWorldHint?: boolean;
}) => {
  // ... implementation to create record ...
  return {
    success: true,
    message: "Record created successfully"
  };
};

// Usage example:
const recordConfig = {
  readOnlyHint: false,
  destructiveHint: false,
  idempotentHint: false,
  openWorldHint: false
};

createDatabaseRecord(recordConfig);
```

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

import { createChat } from "../lib/create-chat";

export default function Home() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  async function handleClick() {
    setLoading(true);
    const { repoId } = await createChat();
    router.push(`/app/${repoId}`);
  }

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center h-screen">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">AI App Builder</h1>
      <button
        className="px-4 py-2 mt-4 text-white bg-blue-500 rounded"

A React component for NextJS that automatically keeps the dev server alive. It uses a provided server action to request and manage the dev server.

```tsx
import { FreestyleDevServer } from "freestyle-sandboxes/react/dev-server";
import { requestDevServer } from "./preview-actions";

export function Preview({ repoId }: { repoId: string }) {
  <FreestyleDevServer actions={{ requestDevServer }} repoId={repoId} />;

### MCP for Tool Sharing

Source: https://context7_llms

Explains how MCP (Model Context Protocol) revolutionized tool sharing among AI metaframeworks and models. Before MCP, sharing code executors required individual packages for each integration, which was cumbersome. MCP provides a standard for easy tool sharing.

```English
Before MCP existed, Freestyle wanted to share our code executor with other companies, so in order to share it we were forced to create individual packages for [every AI Metaframework and model we wanted to support](/code-execution/integrations/vercel) — this sucked, which is why most companies didn't bother, a few did.

In November 2024, [MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) changed this, creating a standard that makes it easy for any team to share tools with agents, and for any agent to use them.
```

### Deploy Web Action

Source: https://context7_llms

Defines a server action to deploy a web application by referencing its Git repository. This action automatically fetches the latest code, builds it, and deploys it to specified domains. It also allows for setting environment variables for the deployment.

```ts
"use server";
import { FreestyleSandboxes } from "freestyle-sandboxes";

const freestyle = new FreestyleSandboxes({
  apiKey: process.env.FREESTYLE_API_KEY,
});

export async function deployAction(
  repoId: string, // [!code highlight] the repoId for your app
  domains: string[] // [!code highlight] the domains you want to deploy to
) {
  const { domains } = await freestyle.deployWeb(
    {
      kind: "git",
      repoUrl: `https://git.freestyle.sh/${repoId}`,
    },
    {
      domains,
      envVars: {
        // ... any environment variables you want to set
      },
    }
  );
}
```

--------------------------------

### Initialize Freestyle Sandboxes

Source: https://docs.freestyle.sh/guides/app-builder

Imports the FreestyleSandboxes class and creates an instance, configuring it with an API key from environment variables. This is the primary setup for using the Freestyle Sandboxes service.

```javascript
import { FreestyleSandboxes } from "freestyle-sandboxes";

const freestyle = new FreestyleSandboxes({
  apiKey: process.env.FREESTYLE_API_KEY!
});
```
